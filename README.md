# Pigon (react)

## Why this one?

I realized the original webui was a smoking pile of garbage, so I made it again but this time in react.

## What's missing

- It won't have videochat / calling functionality because I hate webrtc maybe one day I will add it. (The original one has it but it won't work most of the time anyway xD)
- Animations are missing

## Will this replace the original webui?

- Yes and no. We will still have the original webui and this one too, both accessible

## What's next?

- One day I will rewrite the whole backend in go with a bunch of improvements, I will rewrite this webui using react and tailwind, and rewrite the android app too because that one is a pile of garbage too.

## What's used in this project

- Vite + React, react-icons, socket io
